    Cohost effectively closed on 2024 October 1.  This page quickly
    reconstructs the content posted by
    <a href="https://john.colagioia.net">John Colagioia</a>, based on
    the export provided by Cohost.  Future versions of this page may try
    to determine and show when the post replied to somebody else, but
    that information doesn't seem usefully apparent at this time.
